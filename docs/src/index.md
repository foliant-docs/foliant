# Welcome to Foliant!

Foliant is a all-in-one documentation authoring tool. It lets you produce standalone documents in pdf and docx, as well as websites, from single Markdown source.

Foliant is a *higher order* tool, which means that it uses other programs to do its job. For pdf and docx, it uses [Pandoc](http://pandoc.org/), for websites it uses [MkDocs](http://www.mkdocs.org/).

Foliant preprocessors let you include parts of documents in other documents, show and hide content with flags, render diagrams from text, and more.
